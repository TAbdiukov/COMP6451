## Trivia
This course is first planned to be run in the summer 2018-2019, right before the trimesters horror kicks in

Considering 
* the number of places for this course,
* how new the course is, and
* how ~~little~~ practically no information is available for this course, 

I decided to summarise what to know before it starts. Normally all the info is available on the UNSW portal, however I guess because of the transition and redtape on their side not much is known

## Impression
*Seems like this course is a spin-off of the American (U.S.) Princeton University's similar course*
